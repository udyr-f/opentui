description: Install OpenTUI and create your first terminal UI
order: 1
---

# Getting started

OpenTUI is a native terminal UI core written in Zig with TypeScript bindings. The native core exposes a C ABI and can be used from any language. OpenTUI powers OpenCode in production today and will also power terminal.shop. It is an extensible core with a focus on correctness, stability, and high performance. It provides a component-based architecture with flexible layout capabilities, allowing you to create complex terminal applications.

## Installation

OpenTUI is currently [Bun](https://bun.sh) exclusive but Deno and Node support in-progress.

```bash
mkdir my-tui && cd my-tui
bun init -y
bun add @opentui/core
```

## Hello world

Create `index.ts`:

```typescript
import { createCliRenderer, Text } from "@opentui/core"

const renderer = await createCliRenderer({
  exitOnCtrlC: true,
})

renderer.root.add(
  Text({
    content: "Hello, OpenTUI!",
    fg: "#00FF00",
  }),
)
```

Run it:

```bash
bun index.ts
```

You should see green text. Press `Ctrl+C` to exit.

## Composing components

Components nest naturally. Here's a bordered panel with content:

```typescript
import { createCliRenderer, Box, Text } from "@opentui/core"

const renderer = await createCliRenderer({
  exitOnCtrlC: true,
})

renderer.root.add(
  Box(
    { borderStyle: "rounded", padding: 1, flexDirection: "column", gap: 1 },
    Text({ content: "Welcome", fg: "#FFFF00" }),
    Text({ content: "Press Ctrl+C to exit" }),
  ),
)
```

`Box` and `Text` are factory functions. The first argument is props; additional arguments are children.
